# Daily Warmups

> Programming challenges are great for daily warmups. Instead of inventing them the night before, reference this repo to find an appropriate challenge for your students.

Warmups are divided into their respective topics. This is useful because you may want to grab different kinds of warmups during different times in a cohort. There is ​*no*​ imposed order to these.

Just grab the one you think is most fitting at any given time!
