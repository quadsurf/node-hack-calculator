# Team Feature Branching

* Working with everyone at your group:
        * Fork and clone this repo
    * Create a branch for coordinating your group
        * Make a valid `index.html` file
        * Everyone should make a new feature branch for themselves
        * Everyone should add a new HTML page in the `pages` folder in that feature branch
        * Add a link to it in the `index.html` file
        * Merge all of the feature-branches from your table into your coordinating branch
        * Resolve any conflicts
    * Everyone should pull request back to this repo with all of their teammates pages and links

Note that you will have to communicate a lot to do this well!
