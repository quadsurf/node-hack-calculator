# Fibonaccii Sequence

Give your students the prompt and see what the solutions they come up with look like. After that you can release the solutions and benchmarking files. The files themselves are runnable with test code, and with benchmarks.

The solutions and benchmarking are intended to show the weakness of recursion particularly, but also the strength of 'memoization' or 'caching' which is among the most common performance optimization techniques.
