Write a function that determines if any given number is a Lychrel Number. Begin with just two digit numbers.

* Swap the position of each number (so 41 would become 14)
* Add it to the original number (41 + 14)
* Check if it's a palindrome (in this case 55 is one, so we'd stop)
* If not, repeat steps 1 - 3 until it is.
