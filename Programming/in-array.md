Implement a function which determines whether or not something is in an array. The function should be defined with two parameters, one of which is an array, the other which is either a string or integer. ie: Arguments [1,2,3], and 3, would return true. Arguments [1,2,3], 4, would return false.

Implement a function which determines if an element appears more than once in an array.
