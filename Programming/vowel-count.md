Write a function that pulls the vowels out of a string and tells you the number of vowels. The function should return an array with the vowels used and the number of vowels as the last item in the array as “n vowels". If a vowel is used more than once in the array it will NOT appear in the array more than once.

```
var string = “I don’t know if this sentence has vowels in it.”

findVowels(string)
 //-> [ “i”, “o”, “e”, “a”, "4 vowels" ]
```
