#Identify This Code - Roman Numerals

Students should be shown the unidentifiedCode.js file, and asked to descern what this code does. Once they correctly identify that it converts a string to it's roman numeral value, ask them to refactor the code so that it's easier to identify.

Once they've refactored, feel free to show them romanNumerals.js which should be eminently readable.

Writing code that other programmers can quickly read and understand is one of the most important skills a programmer can develop. Reading obfustacted code is a good way to develop intuition for what makes code hard to read later. 

Ask the students to think about what makes good variable and function name.
