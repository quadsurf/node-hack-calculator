Write a function that uses one or more loops and takes two arrays and returns an object that has the items in the first array as properties and the items in the second array as values.

```
var array1 = [ "cat", "dog", "fish" ],
    array2 = [ "lion", "pointer", "trout" ]

animalMatch(array1, array2);
//-> animals = {
  cat: "lion",
  dog: "pointer",
  fish: "trout"
}
```
